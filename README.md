# GitHub Actions Workflow for Build and Deployment

This project utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` file and includes various steps to ensure a smooth and efficient build process.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
github-actions-workflow
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── build-and-deploy.yml  # GitHub Actions workflow configuration
├── scripts
│   ├── validate.ps1               # Validates input parameters for the build process
│   ├── prebuild.ps1               # Executes prebuild tasks
│   ├── testRelativePathIncludes.ps1 # Tests relative path inclusions
│   ├── validateXmlConfig.ps1      # Validates XML configuration files

## Getting Started

To set up the GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Configure Secrets**: If your workflow requires any secrets (like API keys), make sure to add them in the GitHub repository settings under "Secrets".
3. **Modify Scripts**: Adjust the PowerShell scripts in the `scripts` directory as needed for your specific build and deployment requirements.
4. **Trigger the Workflow**: The workflow can be triggered by pushing changes to the repository or by manually triggering it from the Actions tab in GitHub.

## Workflow Steps

The workflow includes the following key steps:

- **Validate Input**: Ensures that all necessary input parameters are provided.
- **Prebuild Steps**: Executes any tasks that need to be completed before the main build process.
- **Build and Test**: Runs various PowerShell scripts to compile sources, run tests, and validate configurations.
- **Security Scans**: Utilizes Snyk to perform security scans on the codebase.
- **Packing and Publishing**: Packages the build artifacts and publishes them to the specified location.

## Conclusion

This GitHub Actions workflow provides a comprehensive solution for automating the build and deployment process. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can easily set up and customize the workflow to fit your project's needs.
